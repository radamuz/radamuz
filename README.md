## 👋 Hi, I’m Raúl Adamuz

Cloud / DevOps Engineer focused on **hybrid infrastructure**, **automation** and **AWS**.  
I enjoy designing and implementing **scalable, secure, and reproducible** environments—both on-prem and in the cloud—and documenting everything so it’s easy to understand and maintain.

- **Hybrid & On-Prem** – VMware vSphere, Kubernetes (Talos, K3s) networking, VPNs, routing, HA designs
- **Automation & Scripting** – mainly Bash and Python, plus other tools when they make sense
